Git tags is a reference to a specific commit. It’s often used to mark important point in the history of repositories like version releases.
 
Key differences between Git tags and branches are purpose because tags are used to mark specific points like releases, and branches are used to work on lines that are different for simultaneous development. Also the usage. Tags serve as snapshots or milestones while branches serve as active areas of development.
 
Git tags help in managing & tracking deployment by automating the process using systems like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc when a new tag is pushed.
 
I would use Git tags to ensure a stable & stable environment to the client’s production environment by implementing a Git branching strategy. How that’s done, is not simple, but doable. First, adopt a branching strategy that separates development and stable releases.
 
The steps me and my team would take to ensure that the client’s environment remains unaffected by ongoing development is:
Use a branching strategy
Isolate feature development
Continuous integration (CI)
Staging environment
Deployment strategy
Deployment verification 
Rollback plan
Version control best practices
Communication and documentation
Security and access control.
